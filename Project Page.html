                        1. This Smart Tracking System ( was developed
                        and implemented at the Workshop and Spare Parts
                        Department, SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd<br>

                        2. STS can track the faulty parts which coming to the
                        workshop for undergoing repair process<br>

                        3. STS is based on HF RFID technology, send the
                        tagging data wirelessly to google sheet, monitor the
                        location and repair status of the faulty parts through

                        <h3>INTELLIGENT MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM USING WOUND AND FACIAL ANALYSIS
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Many patients nowadays struggle to obtain and understand basic information relating to their own health, due to the complexity of modern health care systems.
                            Patient engagement encourages patients to improve their health outcomes by themselves and results in better patient care at lower costs.
                            We propose an intelligent diagnosis system using deep learning techniques that can identify and classify user input in the form of images to encourage patient engagement.
